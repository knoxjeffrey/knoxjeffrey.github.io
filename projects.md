Below are some of the projects I have worked on since starting my career as a web developer.  Click on the titles to view the applications:

###[Sinatra: Blackjack Application](http://knoxjeffrey-blackjack.herokuapp.com "Blackjack World")
This is my project for the first Tealeaf Academy course.  Within the course I learnt about the basics of HTTP and the request/response life cyle.  I also handled reponses by rendering/redirecting, processed requests from forms and passed in parameters.  The application made use of Ajax to handle button presses during the game.  For the project I was building dynamic view templates in Erb, learnt to use Sinatra (a light weight web development DSL) and deployed my application to Heroku.  

###[Ruby On Rails: PostIt! Application](http://knoxjeffrey-postit.herokuapp.com "PostIt!")
This is my first project for the second Tealeaf Academy course and involved building a Reddit clone using Ruby On Rails.  This course was amazing and covered so much ground.  Below are some brief summary points about what I covered:

- Database concepts such as relational databases, data modeling and associations
- Migrations
- Active Record
- Rails associations including one-to-many, many-to-many and polymorpic associations
- Validations
- Routes, controllers and views
- DRY code with helpers, partials, application_controller.rb, helper_method and before_action
- Render vs redirect
- Rails forms and ajax in rails
- Modules and gems
- Lots of features in my application such as slugging, user authentication, ajaxified voting, admin roles, time zones and two factor authentication
- Deploying to Heroku

###[D3: Scottish Health Inequality](http://scottish-health-inequality.herokuapp.com "Scottish Health Inequality")
I wanted to gain experience with creating data visualisations based on data sets and D3 looked like a great framework to achieve this.  This came from my interest in healthcare and using data visualisation to help explain complex problems in simple, visual ways.  I started with this project about health inequality in Scotland because I found it both an interesting topic and also a way to try out lots of visualisations in D3.   In the future, I'd like to have the datasets based on the healthcare data for individual patients and to use that to help engage patients more effectively with own health so they actually stick to treatment plans.  This amazing [Ted Talk](http://vimeo.com/103501614) is where I got my inspiration from.  From my work with Ruby On Rails I feel like this is something I can achieve as I understand now how to connect a backend full of patient data to front end visualisations using D3.
