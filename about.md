My name is Jeff Knox and I'm primarily a Ruby on Rails developer.

I have a degree in Computer Science and Management Science and graduated in 2002 from Edinburgh University. However, my work went in a different path with medical devices and I'm only recently coming back into programming.

I setup this blog when I started the Tealeaf Academy course to record what I was learning and as an exercise to improve my understanding.  I have completed the final Rails course, "Build Robust and Production Quality Applications" and well as the "Front End Foundations 2" course from Tealeaf Academy.

I have also built my first production application, [Time Off Tokens](https://www.timeofftokens.com/), which was a great learning experience.  I hope to work on more production projects to gain further experience and am actively seeking work opportunities.
