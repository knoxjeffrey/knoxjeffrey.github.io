My name is Jeff Knox and I'm learning to become a Ruby on Rails developer.

I have a degree in Computer Science and Management Science and graduated in 2002 from Edinburgh University. However, my work went in a different path with medical devices and I'm only recently coming back into programming.

I'm using this blog to record my progress through the Tealeaf Academy course and to make note of useful information I gather along the way.
